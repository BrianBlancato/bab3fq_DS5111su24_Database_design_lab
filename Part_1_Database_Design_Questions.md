# Database Design and Build - Part 1

## Design Questions

### 1) What tables should you build? 
    I will be creating 4 different tables.  The Courses_db will contain course information such as name, description active status, and mnemonic. The Instructors_db contains instructor information such as name and active status.  The Learning_Outcomes_db contains learning outcomes for each course. The last table, Course_Assignment_db, contains what courses are being offered for different terms and who the instructor is.  
      
### 2) For each table, what field(s) will you use for primary keys?
