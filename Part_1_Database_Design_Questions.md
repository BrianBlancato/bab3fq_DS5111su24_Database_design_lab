# Database Design and Build - Part 1

## Design Questions

### 1) What tables should you build? 
I will be creating 4 different tables:  
- **Courses_db**: Contains course information such as name, description active status, and mnemonic.  
- **Instructors_db**: Contains instructor information such as name and active status.  
- **Learning_Outcomes_db**: Contains learning outcomes for each course.  
- **Course_Assignment_db**: Contains what courses are being offered for different terms and who the instructor is.  
      
### 2) For each table, what field(s) will you use for primary keys?
