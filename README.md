This repository contains files related to a database design and query execution lab. The lab is divided into two parts: the initial database design and the query execution with case questions.

## Contents

1. **git_api_creation.sql**: 
   - Sets up the API integration within Snowflake.

2. **db_creation_case_qs.sql**: 
   - Creates the tables using the CSV files located in the `tables` folder of the repository.
   - Contains queries that answer the case questions.

3. **database_design_lab_case_questions.ipynb**: 
   - A Jupyter notebook that separates the queries into individual cells to display the case question outputs for submission, ensuring the output is visible outside of Snowflake.

4. **Part_1_Database_Design_Questions.md**: 
   - Answers questions on how the database tables were created for the first part of the lab.

5. **database_design.png**: 
   - A table diagram referenced within the `Part_1_Database_Design_Questions.md` file.

## Lab Overview

### Part 1: Database Design
- The first part of the lab involves designing the database tables. The design process and decisions are documented in the `Part_1_Database_Design_Questions.md` file.
- The `database_design.png` file provides a visual representation of the table schema.

### Part 2: Query Execution and Case Questions
- The second part of the lab focuses on executing queries to answer specific case questions.
- The `db_creation_case_qs.sql` file includes the SQL script to create the necessary tables and execute the queries.
- The `database_design_lab_case_questions.ipynb` notebook separates the queries into individual cells, making it easy to view the outputs for submission.
